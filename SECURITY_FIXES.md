# Security Fixes Applied

This document outlines the critical security and functionality fixes applied to the two-factor authentication system.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Plaintext Password Storage (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: The `Authorization` model stored user passwords in plaintext in the database.
**Fix**: 
- Removed `password` field from `Authorization` model
- Updated `auth_second` view to trust the `Authorization.user` relationship instead of re-authenticating
- This eliminates the risk of password exposure in database dumps or logs

### 2. ASGI Configuration (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Wrong settings module prevented WebSocket connections from working.
**Fix**: 
- Changed `"mysite.settings"` to `"testsite.settings"` in `asgi.py`
- This enables proper WebSocket functionality for real-time authentication

### 3. Token Security Improvements
**Issue**: Tokens were stored as CharField without uniqueness constraints and had reuse vulnerabilities.
**Fix**:
- Changed `token1` and `token2` to `UUIDField` with `unique=True`
- Added proper token lifecycle management (token1 cleared after use)
- Added expiry checks in both `authorize` and `auth_second` views

### 4. Expiry Handling (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Expiry default was evaluated at import time, making all records expire at the same time.
**Fix**:
- Changed to callable default: `default=lambda: timezone.now() + timezone.timedelta(seconds=30)`
- Added expiry checks in views to prevent use of expired tokens
- Removed unsafe `threading.Timer` approach (not safe for web workers)

### 5. WebSocket Client Management
**Issue**: Global client list with no cleanup led to memory leaks and race conditions.
**Fix**:
- Added proper cleanup in `disconnect()` method
- Added error handling for WebSocket connections
- Improved error reporting to clients

### 6. Sensitive Data Logging
**Issue**: Tokens and user information were printed to logs.
**Fix**:
- Removed sensitive data from log output
- Added structured logging without exposing secrets

### 7. HTTP Response Security
**Issue**: Error responses returned 200 status codes instead of proper error codes.
**Fix**:
- Use `HttpResponseForbidden` for authentication failures
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error conditions

## Functionality Improvements

### 1. URL Routing
- Updated templates to use Django's `{% url %}` tags instead of hardcoded paths
- This makes the application more maintainable and less prone to URL errors

### 2. Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling in WebSocket consumer
- Added user-friendly error messages in templates
- Added proper exception handling in views

### 3. Database Optimization
- Added index on `expires` field for efficient cleanup queries
- Removed redundant database queries in views

### 4. Management Command
- Created `cleanup_expired_auths` management command for periodic cleanup
- Supports dry-run mode for testing

## Configuration Updates

### Settings Improvements
- Added `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` for development
- Added `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` setting for consistent email sending

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Application
1. Install dependencies: `pip install django channels daphne`
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`

### Periodic Cleanup
Run the cleanup command periodically to remove expired authorizations:
```bash
python manage.py cleanup_expired_auths
```

For testing (dry-run):
```bash
python manage.py cleanup_expired_auths --dry-run
```

### Production Considerations
1. **Move secrets to environment variables**:
   - `SECRET_KEY`
   - Database credentials
   - Email credentials
2. **Set `DEBUG = False`** in production
3. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
4. **Consider using Redis** for channel layers instead of in-memory client list
5. **Set up proper logging** without sensitive data
6. **Use a proper task queue** (Celery) for periodic cleanup instead of management commands

## Migration Notes
The migration `0003_remove_password_update_tokens.py` will:
- Remove the `password` field (data will be lost)
- Convert token fields to UUID with uniqueness constraints
- Add database index for performance

**Important**: This migration will delete the password field. Ensure you have backups if needed.

## Testing
After applying these fixes:
1. Test the complete authentication flow
2. Verify WebSocket connections work properly
3. Test expiry handling by waiting 30+ seconds
4. Verify cleanup command works correctly
5. Test error conditions (invalid tokens, expired tokens, etc.)
